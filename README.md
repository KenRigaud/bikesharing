#Overview of the statistical analysis:

##The purpose of the analysis
	This analysis was designed to gauge demographic information and understand the density and duration of Citi bike usage.

##Results:
	Images were generated by tableau and stored within the resources folder that showcase multiple filters placed on the data. There is a gender filter, hour filter, and a heatwave case that showcases the various scopes on the same trip data

##Summary:
Based on these results it's easy to strategize marketing for various services provided for bikesharing. Plans such as when to perform bike maintenance, adding a higher toll for greater demand times, and which groups to market on. In the future, using more filters can have an even greater impact on business strategy. Especially in the form of running ads and where most bikesharing clients ride to.
